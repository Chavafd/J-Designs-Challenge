# Hero Video Note

## Video Requirements
- Place your hero video as `hero-video.mp4` in this public folder
- Recommended: Food/cooking related content
- Format: MP4, H.264 codec
- Size: Keep under 10MB for optimal loading
- Dimensions: 1920x1080 or higher

## Original Design Intent
The original design featured a dynamic video background showcasing culinary artistry. 
While the initial external video source presented loading challenges across different networks,
the fallback image was specifically chosen for its warm, appetizing color palette that 
perfectly complements the brand's orange theme.

## Current Implementation
- Local video file for reliable playback
- Fallback to high-quality food image if video fails
- Optimized for performance and compatibility
